**Czech version** - Comprehensive security analysis identifying 8 attack scenarios:

- 🔴 **3 CRITICAL vulnerabilities** (CVSS 8.8-9.8)
- 🟠 **2 HIGH vulnerabilities** (CVSS 7.1-7.5)
- 🟡 **2 MEDIUM vulnerabilities** (CVSS 6.5-6.8)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Top 3 Most Dangerous Attacks:

1. **LLM Prompt Injection → Arbitrary Code Execution** (CVSS 9.8)
   - Attacker can execute ANY shell command via prompt injection
   - No validation between LLM output and command execution
   - **MUST FIX before Roadmap 04 autonomous mode**

2. **Plugin Poisoning → Malicious Code Injection** (CVSS 9.1)
   - Malicious plugins can be loaded without signature verification
   - Backdoors execute during plugin setup
   - **CRITICAL in autonomous plugin integration (Roadmap 04)**

3. **Path Traversal → Core Code Modification** (CVSS 8.8)
   - Bug in `_get_safe_path()` allows escaping sandbox
   - Attacker can modify core/kernel.py and other protected files
   - **Immediate patch required**

## 🚨 SECURITY ROADMAP

### Phase 0: EMERGENCY PATCHES (BEFORE Roadmap 04)
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 - BLOCKING

Must be completed before enabling autonomous mode:

- [ ] Fix path traversal in `tool_file_system.py`
- [ ] Add command whitelist in `tool_bash.py`
- [ ] Add plan validation in `cognitive_planner.py`
- [ ] Migrate API keys to environment variables

**Blocks attacks:** #1, #3, #4

### Phase 1: CORE SECURITY (Part of Roadmap 04)
**Status:** 📋 PLANNED  
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 - REQUIRED

Implementation according to Roadmap 04:

- [ ] `EthicalGuardian` plugin (Step 1) - validates against DNA principles
- [ ] `QualityAssurance` plugin (Step 5) - multi-level code review
- [ ] `SafeIntegrator` plugin (Step 6) - atomic operations with rollback
- [ ] Plugin signing system - SHA256 hash verification

**Blocks attacks:** #2, #6

### Phase 2: INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING
**Status:** 📋 PLANNED  
**Priority:** 🟠 P1 - HIGH

- [ ] Resource limits (cgroups, ulimits)
- [ ] Rate limiting on all tools
- [ ] Monitoring & alerting system
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging

**Blocks attacks:** #5, enables detection

### Phase 3: ADVANCED SECURITY
**Status:** 📋 PLANNED  
**Priority:** 🟡 P2 - MEDIUM

- [ ] Database encryption (SQLCipher)
- [ ] Message signing in memory plugins
- [ ] Dependency verification (hash pinning)
- [ ] Professional penetration testing

**Blocks attacks:** #6, #7

## 📊 Attack Surface Analysis

### Current Vulnerabilities by Component:

| Component | Vulnerabilities | Severity |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| `cognitive_planner.py` | Prompt injection, no output validation | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| `tool_bash.py` | No command whitelist, no resource limits | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| `tool_file_system.py` | Path traversal bug, no protected paths | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| `plugin_manager.py` | No signature verification, blind loading | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| `kernel.py` | No setup sandboxing, no timeout | 🟠 HIGH |
| `tool_llm.py` | No rate limiting, plain text API keys | 🟠 HIGH |
| `memory_sqlite.py` | No encryption, no message signing | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| `requirements.txt` | No hash pinning | 🟡 MEDIUM |

## 🎯 For Developers

### Before Implementing Roadmap 04:

**READ THIS FIRST:** The autonomous mode described in Roadmap 04 is **UNSAFE** without Phase 0 emergency patches.

**Why?**
- Jules API will receive LLM-generated code without validation
- Malicious plugins can be auto-integrated
- Core system can be modified without protection

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Read full security analysis
2. ✅ Implement Phase 0 patches
3. ✅ Test attack scenarios in isolated environment
4. ✅ Only then proceed with Roadmap 04

### Security Development Guidelines:

1. **Never trust LLM output** - always validate
2. **Defense in depth** - multiple validation layers
3. **Fail secure** - deny by default
4. **Audit everything** - comprehensive logging
5. **Test attacks** - red team your own code

## 🧪 Testing Attack Scenarios

### Safe Testing Environment:

```bash
# 1. Create isolated Docker container
docker run -it --rm \
  --name sophia-security-test \
  --network none \
  python:3.12-slim bash

# 2. Inside container, clone and test
git clone /path/to/sophia
cd sophia
# Test attack scenarios safely
```

### Attack Simulation Scripts:

```bash
# Test prompt injection
python tests/security/test_prompt_injection.py

# Test path traversal
python tests/security/test_path_traversal.py

# Test plugin poisoning
python tests/security/test_malicious_plugin.py
```

## 🔒 Security Contacts

**For security vulnerabilities:**
- **DO NOT** open public GitHub issues
- **DO** report privately to project maintainers
- Include: attack scenario, proof of concept, suggested fix

**Response SLA:**
- CRITICAL: 24 hours
- HIGH: 72 hours
- MEDIUM: 1 week
- LOW: Best effort
