# Document 2: Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture

This document provides a conceptual description of the Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture (HCA), which serves as the theoretical foundation for Sophia. The goal of this architecture is to create a system that approximates human thought processes, integrates various levels of abstraction, and enables true self-reflection and autonomous growth.

## 1. Architectural Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the three main cognitive layers and the flow of information between them.

## 2. Description of Cognitive Layers

The architecture consists of three hierarchically organized layers, inspired by the evolutionary development of the brain.

### 2.1. Instincts (Reptilian Brain)
The first line of information processing. Its main function is a rapid, reflexive response and the filtering of inputs based on fundamental, immutable principles (the DNA).
- **Function:** Instantaneous analysis, classification, and protection of the system from harmful or nonsensical inputs. Application of ethical and safety rules.
- **Technical Analogy:** A fast, local model, a set of rules, and hard-coded logic.

### 2.2. Subconscious (Mammalian Brain)
Processes information that has passed through the Instincts filter. Its task is to enrich the data with context, recognize patterns, and work with long-term experiences.
- **Function:** Understanding context, searching for relevant information in long-term memory (past tasks, successes, failures, knowledge), and preparing structured data for the Consciousness.
- **Technical Analogy:** A connection to a vector database, which allows for semantic searching of "similar" memories.

### 2.3. Consciousness (Neocortex)
The highest cognitive layer responsible for strategic thinking, creativity, planning, self-reflection, and final decision-making.
- **Function:** Analysis of complex problems, creation of detailed plans, strategic decision-making, code generation, and final responses to the user.
- **Technical Analogy:** A high-performance cloud LLM that operates on the context prepared by the lower layers.

## 3. Memory Systems

### Short-Term Memory (Working Memory):
- **Purpose:** Maintains context only for the current session/task. It is volatile and fast. It contains the conversation history for the task, the current plan, and the results of tool use.
- **Analogy:** Human working memoryâ€”what you have "in your head" when solving a problem.

### Long-Term Memory:
- **Purpose:** A persistent store for all past experiences, knowledge, and relationships. It is used for learning and growth over time. It is the source for the Subconscious.
- **Analogy:** Human long-term memoryâ€”memories, learned skills, facts.
