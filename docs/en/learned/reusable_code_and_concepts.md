# Reusable Code and Concepts

This document contains a curated list of code snippets, design patterns, and concepts from the archives that are directly applicable to the new MVP.

## 1. Core Kernel Logic (from `nomad-archived`)

The `NomadOrchestratorV2`'s state machine provides a production-ready blueprint for the `ConsciousnessLoop` in `core/kernel.py`.

**Concept: Proactive State Machine**

Instead of a rigid, pre-defined plan, the core loop should be a simple, continuous cycle that decides the single best next action at each step.

**Code Snippet: State Machine Loop**

This is the core execution loop. It can be adapted to call the `PluginManager` instead of a hard-coded `MCPClient`.

```python
# Inspired by NomadOrchestratorV2.execute_mission

class Kernel:
    # ... (setup)

    async def consciousness_loop(self):
        self.current_state = "THINKING" # Or some initial state

        while self.current_state != "MISSION_COMPLETE":
            if self.current_state == "THINKING":
                # 1. Use a thinking/LLM plugin to decide the next action
                # 2. This action could be a tool call or mission_complete
                # 3. Update state to EXECUTING_PLUGIN
                pass
            elif self.current_state == "EXECUTING_PLUGIN":
                # 1. Use PluginManager to execute the chosen plugin
                # 2. On success, append result to context and return to THINKING
                # 3. On failure, append error and transition to HANDLING_ERROR
                pass
            elif self.current_state == "HANDLING_ERROR":
                # 1. Use a thinking/LLM plugin to decide a corrective action
                # 2. Update state to EXECUTING_PLUGIN with the new action
                pass

            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
```

## 2. LLM Interaction and Prompting (from `nomad-archived`)

The `_build_prompt` and `_parse_llm_response` methods are highly reusable for any plugin that needs to interact with an LLM (e.g., `tool_llm.py`).

**Concept: Structured Prompting**

A robust prompt should always contain the same key sections: the high-level goal, the available tools, the history of previous actions, and a clear final instruction.

**Code Snippet: Prompt Building**

```python
# Inspired by NomadOrchestratorV2._build_prompt

def build_system_prompt(goal: str, history: list, available_tools: str) -> str:
    history_str = "\n".join([f"**{item['role'].upper()}**:\n{item['content']}" for item in history])
    instruction = "Analyze the goal and history. What is the single best next step (as a tool call) to achieve the goal?"

    return f"""
You are an autonomous AI assistant. Your goal is to solve the user's request by calling tools.

**MISSION GOAL:** {goal}

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**
{available_tools}

**MISSION HISTORY:**
{history_str}

**INSTRUCTION:**
{instruction}

You must respond with a single JSON object representing the tool call.
"""
```

**Concept: Robust JSON Parsing**

LLMs don't always return perfect JSON. Wrapping the response in a regex to extract the JSON block before parsing is a resilient pattern.

**Code Snippet: Parsing LLM Response**

```python
# Inspired by NomadOrchestratorV2._parse_llm_response
import re
import json

def parse_llm_json_response(llm_response: str) -> dict:
    try:
        match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', llm_response, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            json_str = match.group(0)
            return json.loads(json_str)
        return {"error": "No JSON object found in response"}
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return {"error": f"Failed to decode JSON: {llm_response}"}

```

## 3. Memory System Interfaces (from `sophia-archived`)

The `memory_systems.py` file provides a clean and simple API for both short-term and long-term memory, which can be directly used as the contract for our new memory plugins.

**Concept: Abstracted Memory API**

The implementation details of the memory backend (in-memory dict, SQLite, ChromaDB) should be hidden behind a simple, consistent interface.

**Code Snippet: Short-Term Memory API**

This interface is perfect for the `memory_sqlite` plugin.

```python
# Inspired by ShortTermMemory class

class ShortTermMemoryPlugin:
    def get(self, session_id: str) -> dict:
        # ... implementation ...
        pass

    def set(self, session_id: str, data: dict) -> None:
        # ... implementation ...
        pass

    def update(self, session_id: str, partial_data: dict) -> None:
        # ... implementation ...
        pass

    def clear(self, session_id: str) -> None:
        # ... implementation ...
        pass
```

**Code Snippet: Long-Term Memory API**

This interface is the perfect starting point for the `memory_chroma` plugin.

```python
# Inspired by LongTermMemory class

class LongTermMemoryPlugin:
    def add_record(self, text: str, metadata: dict) -> str:
        # ... implementation to create embedding and store ...
        pass

    def search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[dict]:
        # ... implementation to create query embedding and search ...
        pass
```

## 4. Autonomous Memory Consolidation (from `sophia-old-archived`)

The "dreaming" concept is a powerful idea for making the agent's long-term memory more intelligent and curated.

**Concept: "Dreaming" for Knowledge Curation**

After a user session is complete, a background process or a dedicated agent analyzes the session's short-term memory (the conversation transcript). It identifies key facts, insights, or successful solutions and saves a distilled, canonical version to the long-term semantic memory store. This prevents the LTM from being cluttered with conversational noise.

**High-Level Implementation Idea:**

This would be a feature for a future version of the `memory_chroma` plugin.

```python
# High-level concept for a "dreaming" function

class LongTermMemoryPlugin:
    # ... (add_record, search)

    def consolidate_session(self, session_history: list[dict]):
        # 1. Create a prompt for an LLM that asks it to extract key insights
        #    from the conversation history.
        prompt = f"Analyze the following conversation and extract any key facts, learned lessons, or important information that should be saved for the future. Conversation:\n{session_history}"

        # 2. Call the LLM.
        # insights = llm.generate(prompt)

        # 3. Parse the insights and save them to the vector store.
        # for insight in insights:
        #     self.add_record(insight, {"source_session": session_id})
        pass
```
