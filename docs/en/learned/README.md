# Sophia Archives: A Knowledge Base

This directory contains a distilled knowledge base extracted from the analysis of three archival branches of the Sophia project. Its purpose is to leverage past work to accelerate future development, avoid repeating mistakes, and provide a rich source of inspiration.

The analysis covers three distinct evolutionary stages of Sophia:

1.  **The State Machine (`archive/nomad-archived`):** A robust, procedural orchestrator built around a state machine.
2.  **The Cognitive Architecture (`archive/sophia-archived`):** A highly abstract, bio-inspired hierarchical model for reasoning.
3.  **The Framework Prototype (`archive/sophia-old-archived`):** A rapid implementation leveraging the `CrewAI` framework.

## Index of Documents

*   **[Architectural Insights](./architectural_insights.md):** A deep dive into the core architectural patterns from each archived version. This document explores the pros and cons of each approach and provides recommendations for the current Core-Plugin architecture.

*   **[Reusable Code and Concepts](./reusable_code_and_concepts.md):** A curated collection of code snippets, design patterns, and high-level concepts that are directly reusable or can serve as strong inspiration for the MVP and future plugins.

*   **[Key Lessons Learned](./lessons_learned.md):** An honest look at the challenges and "dead ends" encountered in previous versions. This document is crucial for avoiding past mistakes.

*   **[Inspiration for the MVP Roadmap](./inspiration_for_roadmap.md):** A targeted analysis connecting specific findings from the archives to the concrete steps outlined in the current MVP roadmap.
