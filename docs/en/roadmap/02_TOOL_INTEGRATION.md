# Roadmap 02: Tool Integration

**Phase Goal:** To equip Sophia with a foundational set of tools, enabling her to interact with and modify both the digital world and her own software environment. This phase transforms Sophia from a purely conversational entity into a functional agent.

The detailed implementation plan for this phase will be created upon the successful completion of the MVP.

### Key Objectives:

1.  **File System Plugin (`tool_file_system`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow Sophia to read, write, and list files and directories.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`.

2.  **Bash Shell Plugin (`tool_bash`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Grant Sophia the ability to execute arbitrary shell commands within her sandboxed environment.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `execute_command`.
    *   **Critical Note:** This plugin must have robust safety mechanisms, including command whitelisting/blacklisting and timeout enforcement.

3.  **Git Operations Plugin (`tool_git`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Enable Sophia to interact with her own source code repository.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `git_clone`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_commit`, `git_push`.

4.  **Web Search Plugin (`tool_web_search`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provide Sophia with the ability to access up-to-date information from the internet.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `search_web`, `read_website_content`.

**Success Criteria:** Sophia can, when instructed, clone a repository, read a file from it, search the web for information related to that file, and then write a summary to a new file, all without human intervention beyond the initial command.
