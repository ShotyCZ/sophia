# Roadmap 03: Self-Analysis Framework

**Phase Goal:** To develop Sophia's capacity for introspection. This phase involves creating a suite of cognitive plugins that allow her to read, understand, and reason about her own structure, code, and documentation. This is the critical step before true autonomy can be considered.

The detailed implementation plan for this phase will be created upon the successful completion of the Tool Integration phase.

### Key Objectives:

1.  **Code Comprehension Plugin (`cognitive_code_reader`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow Sophia to read and build a mental model of her own source code.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `analyze_codebase`, `get_class_definition`, `get_function_signature`, `list_plugins`.

2.  **Documentation Comprehension Plugin (`cognitive_doc_reader`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Enable Sophia to read and understand her own documentation, turning it into an actionable source of truth for her behavior.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `read_document`, `find_guideline`, `get_architectural_overview`.

3.  **Dependency Analysis Plugin (`cognitive_dependency_analyzer`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Grant Sophia the ability to understand her software dependencies.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `list_dependencies`, `check_dependency_version`.

4.  **Historical Analysis Plugin (`cognitive_historian`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow Sophia to learn from the project's history by analyzing the `WORKLOG.md` and other historical records.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `review_past_missions`, `identify_past_failures`, `summarize_agent_performance`.

**Success Criteria:** Sophia can be asked, "According to your documentation, what are the mandatory steps for creating a new plugin, and are there any existing plugins that perform a similar function?" She should be able to answer this question correctly by using these self-analysis tools.
