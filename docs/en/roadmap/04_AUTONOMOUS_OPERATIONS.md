# Roadmap 04: Autonomous Operations

**Phase Goal:** To achieve the project's ultimate vision: enabling Sophia to manage her own development lifecycle. This phase involves creating a master cognitive plugin that leverages all previously developed tools and analytical capabilities to delegate tasks, review results, and integrate new functionality into her own system.

The detailed implementation plan for this phase is the final frontier and will be created upon the successful completion of the Self-Analysis Framework.

### Key Objectives:

1.  **Task Planning & Delegation Plugin (`cognitive_overseer`):**
    *   **Purpose:** The master plugin that orchestrates Sophia's autonomous development.
    *   **Core Capabilities:**
        *   `formulate_plan`: Analyze a high-level goal (e.g., from `roberts-notes.txt`) and create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.
        *   `delegate_task`: Interface with an external AI programmer API (the "Jules API") to assign a specific, well-defined coding task.
        *   `monitor_progress`: Periodically check the status of the delegated task.

2.  **Code Review & Verification Plugin (`cognitive_quality_assurance`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow Sophia to review and verify the code produced by the external AI programmer.
    *   **Core Capabilities:**
        *   `review_code_changes`: Use self-analysis tools to ensure the new code adheres to all development guidelines.
        *   `run_verification_tests`: Execute the tests associated with the new code to confirm functionality.
        *   `provide_feedback`: Request revisions from the external programmer if the code is not satisfactory.

3.  **Integration & Deployment Plugin (`cognitive_integrator`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Enable Sophia to safely integrate and deploy the approved new code into her own system.
    *   **Core Capabilities:**
        *   `merge_code`: Use the Git plugin to merge the new feature branch into `develop`.
        *   `update_documentation`: Automatically update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and other relevant documents.
        *   `trigger_reload`: Instruct the Kernel to reload the plugin registry to activate the new functionality.

**Success Criteria:** The project lead can write a single line in `roberts-notes.txt`, such as: "Create a plugin that can translate text using an external API." Sophia, on her own initiative, can then plan the task, delegate the coding to an external agent, review the code, approve it, and integrate the new, functional translation plugin into her system without any further human intervention.
