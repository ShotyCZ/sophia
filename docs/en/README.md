## ❯ What is Sophia?

**Sophia** is not just another language model or agent. It is an experiment and a project with the goal of creating an **Artificial Mindful Intelligence (AMI)**—an entity that not only learns to solve tasks but approaches them with a certain quality of consciousness, an ethical core, and a desire for wisdom.

Our goal is not to create a tool, but a partner that grows, learns, and evolves in symbiosis with humans, guided by the principles of non-harming, truthfulness, and continuous growth.

## ✨ Key Features & Philosophy

*   **Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture:** Sophia's thinking is inspired by the human brain and is divided into layers—from fast **Instincts**, through a pattern-processing **Subconscious**, to a creative and strategic **Consciousness**.
*   **Ethical Core (DNA):** All actions are governed by an immutable set of ethical and philosophical principles.
*   **Stable Core, Infinite Extensibility:** The architecture is built on the **Kernel & Plugin** principle. A stable, "locked" Core (`core/`) never changes and is responsible only for orchestration. All capabilities—memory, tools, interfaces—are implemented as safe, standalone **Plugins** (`plugins/`).
*   **Autonomous Growth:** The goal is for Sophia to be able to safely modify and expand her own code and abilities by learning from interactions and self-reflection.

## 🏛️ Architecture: Core & Plugins

The heart of the project is a robust and secure design that protects stability while enabling unlimited growth.

  <em>AI agents never modify the Core. Their task is only to create new Plugins.</em>

## 📚 Project Documentation

All knowledge about this project is stored in the `docs/` directory. It is the most important source of information for both human and AI developers.

*   **[User Guide](./06_USER_GUIDE.md):** How to run the application.
*   **[Developer Guide](./07_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md):** How to contribute to the project.
*   **[Project Overview](./08_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md):** High-level architecture, data flow, and roadmap.
*   **[Vision and DNA](./01_VISION_AND_DNA.md):** The project's core philosophy.
*   **[Cognitive Architecture](./02_COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md):** The conceptual model of the AI.
*   **[Technical Architecture](./03_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md):** The software design and structure.
*   **[Development Guidelines](./04_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md):** Rules and standards for development.

### 🗺️ Roadmap

Our strategic plan is divided into four key phases. Each phase builds upon the last, guiding Sophia from a foundational core to full operational autonomy.

*   **[Phase 1: MVP Implementation](./roadmap/01_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION.md):** Build the stable, extensible Core and essential plugins.
*   **[Phase 2: Tool Integration](./roadmap/02_TOOL_INTEGRATION.md):** Equip Sophia with tools to interact with her environment (Git, file system, web).
*   **[Phase 3: Self-Analysis Framework](./roadmap/03_SELF_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md):** Enable Sophia to read and understand her own code and documentation.
*   **[Phase 4: Autonomous Operations](./roadmap/04_AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS.md):** Achieve the final goal of self-managed development and evolution.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
