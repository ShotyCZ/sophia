## ❯ What is Sophia?

**Sophia** is not just another language model or agent. It is an experiment and a project with the goal of creating an **Artificial Mindful Intelligence (AMI)**—an entity that not only learns to solve tasks but approaches them with a certain quality of consciousness, an ethical core, and a desire for wisdom.

Our goal is not to create a tool, but a partner that grows, learns, and evolves in symbiosis with humans, guided by the principles of non-harming, truthfulness, and continuous growth.

## ✨ Key Features & Philosophy

*   **Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture:** Sophia's thinking is inspired by the human brain and is divided into layers—from fast **Instincts**, through a pattern-processing **Subconscious**, to a creative and strategic **Consciousness**.
*   **Ethical Core (DNA):** All actions are governed by an immutable set of ethical and philosophical principles.
*   **Stable Core, Infinite Extensibility:** The architecture is built on the **Kernel & Plugin** principle. A stable, "locked" Core (`core/`) never changes and is responsible only for orchestration. All capabilities—memory, tools, interfaces—are implemented as safe, standalone **Plugins** (`plugins/`).
*   **Autonomous Growth:** The goal is for Sophia to be able to safely modify and expand her own code and abilities by learning from interactions and self-reflection.

## 🏛️ Architecture: Core & Plugins

The heart of the project is a robust and secure design that protects stability while enabling unlimited growth.

  <em>AI agents never modify the Core. Their task is only to create new Plugins.</em>

## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is in the active development phase. To run the current version, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kajobert/sophia.git
    cd sophia
    ```
2.  **Set Up the Environment:**
    *   Create a `.env` file and fill in the necessary API keys and configurations according to `config/settings.yaml`.
3.  **Run with Docker (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
