**Mission:** Mission 3: Kernel and Terminal Interface Implementation
**Agent:** Jules v1.4
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Implement the `Kernel` class in `core/kernel.py`.
*   Create the `TerminalInterface` plugin.
*   Update the application entry point `run.py`.
*   Create a test for the `Kernel`.
*   Remove the dummy plugin.
*   Run tests and quality checks.
*   Verify the application functionality.
*   Refactor all code to English.
*   Synchronize Czech documentation with the English version.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Implemented the `Kernel`'s `consciousness_loop` in `core/kernel.py`.
*   Created the `TerminalInterface` plugin in `plugins/interface_terminal.py`.
*   Updated `run.py` to start the `Kernel`.
*   Created `tests/core/test_kernel.py` to test the `Kernel`.
*   Removed the `plugins/dummy_plugin.py` file.
*   Fixed test failures by installing `pytest-asyncio`, updating `tests/core/test_plugin_manager.py`, and creating a `pytest.ini` file.
*   Resolved pre-commit failures by creating a `pyproject.toml` file to align `black` and `ruff` configurations.
*   Fixed a runtime error in the `consciousness_loop` by wrapping coroutines in `asyncio.create_task`.
*   Refactored all new and modified code to be exclusively in English, per a priority directive.
*   Synchronized the Czech `AGENTS.md` with the English version.
*   Verified the application runs and waits for user input.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The Kernel is now functional, and the application can be interacted with via the terminal. The codebase is fully in English, and the documentation is synchronized.

**Mission:** Mission 2: Dynamic Plugin Manager Implementation
**Agent:** Jules v1.3
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Translate the `PluginManager` code to English.
*   Implement the `PluginManager` in `core/plugin_manager.py`.
*   Create a test plugin `plugins/dummy_plugin.py`.
*   Create a test file `tests/core/test_plugin_manager.py`.
*   Run tests to verify the implementation.
*   Complete pre-commit steps.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   The Czech code provided in the prompt for `core/plugin_manager.py` was translated to English, including docstrings, comments, and log messages, adhering to Google Style.
*   The translated and improved code was written to `core/plugin_manager.py`.
*   A new test plugin, `DummyTool`, was created in `plugins/dummy_plugin.py` to serve as a test case for discovery.
*   A new test file, `tests/core/test_plugin_manager.py`, was created with a test case to verify that the `PluginManager` correctly loads the `DummyTool`.
*   The tests were executed using `pytest`, and they passed successfully, confirming the `PluginManager` works as expected.
*   Pre-commit steps were completed, including a successful code review.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The `PluginManager` is now fully functional and capable of dynamically loading plugins. The project is ready for the next step in the MVP roadmap: implementing the Core Kernel and the first interface plugin.

**Mission:** Mission 1: Core Skeleton and Plugin Contract
**Agent:** Jules v1.2
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Create `core/context.py`.
*   Create `core/plugin_manager.py`.
*   Create `core/kernel.py`.
*   Create `plugins/base_plugin.py`.
*   Verify the creation and content of the files.
*   Run pre-commit checks.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Created `core/context.py` with the `SharedContext` dataclass.
*   Created `core/plugin_manager.py` with an empty `PluginManager` class.
*   Created `core/kernel.py` with an empty `Kernel` class.
*   Created `plugins/base_plugin.py` with the `BasePlugin` abstract class, defining the plugin contract.
*   Verified that all four files were created with the correct content.
*   Created the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
*   Ran and successfully completed pre-commit checks (`black`, `ruff`, `mypy`).

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The core skeleton and plugin contract are in place. The project is ready for the next step in the roadmap: implementing the `PluginManager`.

**Mission:** Project Environment Setup 'SOPHIA V2'
**Agent:** Jules v1.2
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Audit the existing file structure.
*   Create a bilingual documentation structure (EN/CS).
*   Update and translate all key documentation (`AGENTS.md`, governance, architecture, development guidelines).
*   Enhance documentation based on online research of best practices.
*   Create a new project directory structure (`core`, `plugins`, `config`, etc.).
*   Prepare files in the root directory for a clean project start.
*   Write a final log of actions taken in this file.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Created new directory structures `docs/en` and `docs/cs`.
*   Moved existing documentation to `docs/cs`.
*   Rewrote `AGENTS.md` and created an English version.
*   Created an improved, bilingual version of `05_PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md` based on research.
*   Updated and translated `03_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `04_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` to English.
*   Added a new rule to the development guidelines about the mandatory use of English in code.
*   Created the complete directory structure for `core`, `plugins`, `tests`, `config`, and `logs`.
*   Created empty files (`__init__.py`, `.gitkeep`, `settings.yaml`, etc.) to initialize the structure.
*   Cleared key files in the root directory (`Dockerfile`, `WORKLOG.md`, `IDEAS.md`, `run.py`, `requirements.txt`).

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The "Sophia V2" project environment is ready for further development in accordance with the new architecture. The documentation is up-to-date, the structure is clean, and all rules are clearly defined.
