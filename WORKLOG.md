**Mission:** Mission 6: Implement Long-Term Memory
**Agent:** Jules v1.2
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**

**Mission:** IMPLEMENT WEB UI INTERFACE
**Agent:** Jules v1.10
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Upgrade the Kernel to support a generic response mechanism.
*   Add new dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`) to `requirements.in`.
*   Create the `WebUI` plugin.
*   Create a simple HTML frontend.
*   Run tests to ensure no existing tests were broken.
*   Verify the application and web UI are functional.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Modified `core/kernel.py` to include a "RESPONDING PHASE" that allows plugins to register a callback for receiving responses. This was done by adding a check for `_response_callback` in the context payload.
*   Upgraded the `Kernel` to include a generic `_setup_plugins` method. This method loads configurations from `config/settings.yaml` and calls the `setup` method on all registered plugins, passing their respective configs. This replaced a temporary, hardcoded setup for the memory plugin.
*   Created the `plugins/interface_webui.py` file, which contains the `WebUIInterface` plugin. This plugin starts a FastAPI server to serve a web-based chat interface and handle WebSocket connections.
*   Refactored the `WebUIInterface` plugin to start the Uvicorn server lazily on the first call to the `execute` method. This ensures the server starts within the running asyncio event loop, resolving a critical `RuntimeError`.
*   Created the `frontend/chat.html` file, providing a simple but functional user interface for interacting with Sophia.
*   Added a new endpoint to the FastAPI app within the `WebUIInterface` plugin to serve the `frontend/chat.html` file, which resolved cross-origin policy issues during verification.
*   Updated `config/settings.yaml` to include configuration for the new `interface_webui` plugin.
*   Conducted a significant dependency audit, adding `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and their many transitive dependencies to `requirements.in` to resolve numerous `ModuleNotFoundError` issues during startup and testing. Later refactored `requirements.in` to list only direct dependencies as per code review feedback.
*   Updated the existing test suite in `tests/core/test_plugin_manager.py` to account for the new `WebUIInterface` plugin.
*   Created a new test file, `tests/plugins/test_interface_webui.py`, with unit tests to ensure the new plugin's functionality.
*   Ran the full test suite and confirmed that all tests pass.
*   Manually and programmatically verified that the application starts correctly and the web UI is fully functional and responsive.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. A web-based user interface for Sophia has been successfully implemented, proving the extensibility of the architecture. The application can now be accessed via both the terminal and a web browser. The Kernel has been refactored to support a more robust and scalable plugin initialization process.

**Mission:** HOTFIX: LLMTool Configuration Error
**Agent:** Jules v1.9
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Modify `plugins/tool_llm.py` to self-configure.
*   Run tests to verify the fix.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Identified that the `PluginManager` was not calling the `setup` method on plugins, causing the `LLMTool` to use a default model.
*   To avoid modifying the forbidden `core` directory, I modified the `LLMTool`'s `__init__` method in `plugins/tool_llm.py` to call its own `setup` method, ensuring it loads the correct model from `config/settings.yaml`.
*   Installed project dependencies and ran the full test suite, which passed, confirming the fix.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The `LLMTool` is now correctly configured, and the application can successfully connect to the LLM and generate responses.

---

**Mission:** REFACTOR: Externalize LLM Configuration
**Agent:** Jules v1.8
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Move the hardcoded LLM model name to a `config/settings.yaml` file.
*   Update the `LLMTool` plugin to load the model from the configuration file.
*   Update the tests to support the new configuration-driven approach.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Created `config/settings.yaml` and added the specified model `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025`.
*   Added `PyYAML` to `requirements.in` to handle YAML parsing.
*   Modified `plugins/tool_llm.py` to load the model from the config file at setup, with a sensible fallback.
*   Updated `tests/plugins/test_tool_llm.py` to use a temporary config file, ensuring the test remains isolated and robust.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The LLM model is now configurable, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

---

*   Run tests to confirm the fix.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Researched a suitable free model on OpenRouter and updated the `LLMTool` plugin in `plugins/tool_llm.py` to use `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`.
*   Successfully ran the full test suite to ensure the fix was effective and introduced no regressions.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The application can now successfully connect to the LLM and generate responses.

**Mission:** HOTFIX: Runtime Error and Venv Guard
**Agent:** Jules v1.6
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Fix the `TypeError: Passing coroutines is forbidden` in `core/kernel.py`.
*   Add a virtual environment check to `run.py` to prevent dependency errors.
*   Run tests to confirm the fixes.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Corrected the `asyncio.wait` call in `core/kernel.py` by wrapping the plugin execution coroutines in `asyncio.create_task`.
*   Added a `check_venv()` function to `run.py` that exits the application if it's not being run from within a virtual environment.
*   Successfully ran the full test suite to ensure the fixes were effective and introduced no regressions.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The runtime `TypeError` is resolved, and a safeguard is now in place to ensure the application is always run from the correct environment, preventing future module-not-found errors.

*   Created `tests/plugins/test_tool_llm.py` and `tests/plugins/test_memory_sqlite.py` to test the new plugins.
*   Encountered and resolved issues with `uv pip sync` not installing all transitive dependencies by using `uv pip install -r requirements.in` instead.
*   Successfully ran the full test suite, including the new tests.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. Sophia can now process input using an LLM and store conversation history in a SQLite database. The Kernel has been updated to support these new capabilities.
