## Mission: Critical Bug Fix - BasePlugin Contract Violations
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (AI Developer)  
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Discovery:

During comprehensive backward verification requested by user ("zkontroluj zda testy nejsou zkriplené"), discovered critical architectural bugs in Roadmap 04 implementations.

**Critical Findings:**
*   NotesAnalyzer.execute() violated BasePlugin contract - accepted/returned dict instead of SharedContext
*   TaskManager.execute() violated BasePlugin contract - missing type hints, returned dict
*   35 tests (14 NotesAnalyzer + 21 TaskManager) passed despite violations due to Python duck typing
*   Tests were NOT crippled in logic - they tested REAL functionality
*   But tests were architecturally fragile - violated interface contract

### 2. Actions Taken:

**Plugin Fixes:**

1. **NotesAnalyzer (`plugins/cognitive_notes_analyzer.py`)**:
   - Added import: `from core.context import SharedContext`
   - Fixed execute() signature: `async def execute(self, context: SharedContext) -> SharedContext`
   - Changed return pattern: `context.payload["result"] = result; return context`
   - Fixed _analyze_notes() to accept SharedContext parameter

2. **TaskManager (`plugins/cognitive_task_manager.py`)**:
   - Added import: `from core.context import SharedContext`
   - Fixed execute() signature: `async def execute(self, context: SharedContext) -> SharedContext`
   - Standardized action names: 'create' → 'create_task', 'update' → 'update_task', etc.
   - Changed return pattern: `context.payload["result"] = result; return context`

**Test Fixes:**

3. **NotesAnalyzer Tests (`tests/plugins/test_cognitive_notes_analyzer.py`)**:
   - Added logging import (was missing)
   - Added create_context() helper function
   - Updated all 14 tests to use: `result_ctx = await analyzer.execute(create_context(...))`
   - Extract results: `result = result_ctx.payload.get("result")`

4. **TaskManager Tests (`tests/plugins/test_cognitive_task_manager.py`)**:
   - Updated all 21 tests to extract from payload
   - Fixed 8 additional multi-step execute() calls in integration tests
   - Standardized all action names to match new API
   - Fixed test_task_persistence_across_restarts with proper context handling

### 3. Verification:

**Test Quality Analysis:**
```
Test Quality Metrics:
- test_cognitive_notes_analyzer.py: 14 tests, 52 assertions (3.7 avg)
- test_cognitive_ethical_guardian.py: 20 tests, 66 assertions (3.3 avg), 0 mocks!
- test_cognitive_task_manager.py: 21 tests, 58 assertions (2.8 avg)
- test_cognitive_orchestrator.py: 22 tests, 69 assertions (3.1 avg)

Real Logic Verified:
✅ NotesAnalyzer: Real keyword matching ('simple' → high, 'rewrite' → low)
✅ DNA Alignment: Real pattern detection ('delete' → Ahimsa=False)
✅ EthicalGuardian: Real harmful keyword detection
✅ TaskManager: Real file I/O operations
✅ Zero fake test patterns (no 'assert True', no empty bodies)
```

**Test Results:**
```
Full Test Suite: 187/187 PASSED ✅
- 110 existing tests (other plugins)
- 14 NotesAnalyzer tests ✅
- 20 EthicalGuardian tests ✅
- 21 TaskManager tests ✅
- 22 Orchestrator tests ✅
```

### 3. Result:

**Mission COMPLETED Successfully ✅**

Discovered and fixed critical BasePlugin contract violations that made the codebase fragile and non-standard. While tests verified real logic, they did so through incorrect API.

**Key Achievements:**
1. ✅ All plugins now properly implement BasePlugin.execute(SharedContext) -> SharedContext
2. ✅ All tests use standardized API with create_context() helper
3. ✅ Action names standardized across TaskManager
4. ✅ 187/187 tests passing with correct contract
5. ✅ Code is now robust, standard, and maintainable

**Why This Was Critical:**
- Original code violated fundamental architectural contract
- Tests passed due to duck typing, hiding the violation
- This created technical debt and fragile code
- Future refactoring would have been extremely difficult
- NOW: Clean, standard, contract-compliant code

**Commits:**
- 53590b59: Critical BasePlugin contract fixes for NotesAnalyzer and TaskManager

**Test Conclusion:**
Tests were NOT crippled in terms of logic - they tested real functionality with real data.
Tests WERE crippled architecturally - they accepted wrong API patterns.
Both issues now RESOLVED.

   - Master coordinator for autonomous development workflows
   - 548 lines of implementation
   - Dependencies: cognitive_task_manager, cognitive_notes_analyzer, cognitive_ethical_guardian

2. **Key Features Implemented:**
   - `analyze_goal()`: Multi-layer goal analysis
     * Step 1 (PODVĚDOMÍ): Use NotesAnalyzer to structure goal + context
     * Step 2 (INSTINKTY): Use EthicalGuardian to validate ethics (Ahimsa, Satya, Kaizen)
     * Step 3 (VĚDOMÍ): Strategic decision to create task or reject
     * Step 4 (PODVĚDOMÍ): Create task in TaskManager with enriched context
     * Returns: {success, task_id, analysis, ethical_validation, message}
   
   - `execute_mission()`: Autonomous mission coordination
     * Load task from TaskManager
     * Gather context (similar tasks via pattern recognition)
     * Update task status to 'analyzing'
     * Create strategic plan with next steps
     * (Future: Delegate to external coding agent - Jules API, etc.)
     * Returns: {success, task_id, status, plan, message}
   
   - `get_mission_status()`: Mission progress monitoring
     * Retrieve current task status
     * Access complete history
     * Enable oversight and transparency

3. **Architecture Compliance:**

     * Success path, missing dependencies, ethical rejection
     * Empty analysis, task creation failure, exception handling
   - Execute mission workflow (4 tests):
     * Success path, task not found, similar tasks, missing dependencies
   - Get mission status (3 tests):
     * Success path, task not found, missing dependencies
   - Integration tests (1 test):
     * Full workflow: analyze goal → create task → execute mission

### 2. Actions Taken:

#### Plugin Implementation:
1. **Created NotesAnalyzer Plugin** (`plugins/cognitive_notes_analyzer.py`)
   - HKA Layer: SUBCONSCIOUS (Pattern Recognition)
   - Implements `analyze_notes()` method
   - DNA Principles integrated: Ahimsa (safety validation), Satya (transparent context), Kaizen (learns from history)
   - 471 lines of implementation

2. **Architecture Fix - Dependency Injection**
   - INITIAL MISTAKE: Plugin used `self.kernel.plugin_manager.get_plugin()` - violates Rule 2
   - FIX: Implemented proper dependency injection via `setup(config)`
   - Dependencies: `tool_file_system`, `tool_llm`, `cognitive_doc_reader`, `cognitive_historian`, `cognitive_code_reader`
   - All dependencies injected by Kernel automatically

3. **Key Features Implemented:**
   - `_analyze_notes()`: Reads roberts-notes.txt and extracts structured goals
   - `_extract_ideas()`: Uses LLM to parse unstructured notes into ideas
   - `_enrich_idea()`: Adds context from docs, history, and existing plugins
   - `_assess_feasibility()`: Evaluates idea complexity (high/medium/low)
   - `_validate_dna_alignment()`: Checks Ahimsa/Satya/Kaizen compliance
   - `_formulate_goal()`: Creates structured goal ready for approval

#### Test Suite Creation:
4. **Created Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/plugins/test_cognitive_notes_analyzer.py`)
   - 14 unit tests covering all functionality
   - Tests for empty notes, simple notes, multiple ideas
   - Feasibility assessment tests (high/medium/low)
   - DNA alignment tests (valid/harmful/vague ideas)
   - Error handling tests (file read error, LLM fallback)
   - Goal structure validation tests

5. **Architecture Fix in Tests:**
   - INITIAL: Tests used `mock_kernel.plugin_manager.get_plugin()`
   - FIX: Created proper fixtures (`mock_file_system`, `mock_llm`, etc.)
   - All dependencies injected via `setup(config)` in fixture
   - Cleaner, more maintainable test code

#### Configuration:
6. **Config Verification** (`config/settings.yaml`)
   - Configuration already exists: `cognitive_notes_analyzer`
   - Kernel automatically injects all plugins into `setup(config)`
   - No changes needed - architecture works correctly

### 3. Outcome:

**MISSION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ✅**

#### Test Results:
```
124 passed in 23.14s
Including 14 new NotesAnalyzer tests
ZERO failures ✅
ZERO warnings ✅
```

#### Files Created/Modified:
1. `plugins/cognitive_notes_analyzer.py` - NEW (471 lines)
2. `tests/plugins/test_cognitive_notes_analyzer.py` - NEW (14 tests, 327 lines)
3. `config/settings.yaml` - Already contained `cognitive_notes_analyzer` config
4. `WORKLOG.md` - Updated with this mission

#### Adherence to AGENTS.md:
- ✅ **Rule 1 (Don't Touch Core):** NO core files modified
- ✅ **Rule 2 (Everything is Plugin):** NotesAnalyzer is proper plugin with dependency injection
- ✅ **Rule 3 (Tests Mandatory):** 14 comprehensive tests, 124/124 passing
- ✅ **Rule 4 (Update WORKLOG):** This entry
- ✅ **Rule 6 (English Only):** All code in English
- ✅ **Rule 7 (Workflow):** Analysis → Planning → Implementation → Testing → Documentation

#### Architecture Learning:
**CRITICAL LESSON:** Plugins MUST NOT access `kernel` directly!
- ❌ WRONG: `await self.kernel.plugin_manager.get_plugin("name")`
- ✅ RIGHT: Dependencies injected via `setup(config)` by Kernel
- Kernel auto-injects all plugins into config dict
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier testing with mocks

#### Roadmap 04 Progress:
- ✅ **Step 0:** NotesAnalyzer implemented and tested
- ⏳ **Next:** Step 1 - Implement autonomous goal approval mechanism

**RECOMMENDATION:** ✅ **Step 0 is PRODUCTION READY**

NotesAnalyzer successfully implements HKA SUBCONSCIOUS layer for pattern recognition. Plugin can analyze roberts-notes.txt, extract ideas, enrich with context, validate DNA alignment, and formulate structured goals ready for approval.

**Mission:** IMPLEMENT WEB UI INTERFACE
**Agent:** Jules v1.10
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Upgrade the Kernel to support a generic response mechanism.
*   Add new dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`) to `requirements.in`.
*   Create the `WebUI` plugin.
*   Create a simple HTML frontend.
*   Run tests to ensure no existing tests were broken.
*   Verify the application and web UI are functional.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Modified `core/kernel.py` to include a "RESPONDING PHASE" that allows plugins to register a callback for receiving responses. This was done by adding a check for `_response_callback` in the context payload.
*   Upgraded the `Kernel` to include a generic `_setup_plugins` method. This method loads configurations from `config/settings.yaml` and calls the `setup` method on all registered plugins, passing their respective configs. This replaced a temporary, hardcoded setup for the memory plugin.
*   Created the `plugins/interface_webui.py` file, which contains the `WebUIInterface` plugin. This plugin starts a FastAPI server to serve a web-based chat interface and handle WebSocket connections.
*   Refactored the `WebUIInterface` plugin to start the Uvicorn server lazily on the first call to the `execute` method. This ensures the server starts within the running asyncio event loop, resolving a critical `RuntimeError`.
*   Created the `frontend/chat.html` file, providing a simple but functional user interface for interacting with Sophia.
*   Added a new endpoint to the FastAPI app within the `WebUIInterface` plugin to serve the `frontend/chat.html` file, which resolved cross-origin policy issues during verification.
*   Updated `config/settings.yaml` to include configuration for the new `interface_webui` plugin.
*   Conducted a significant dependency audit, adding `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and their many transitive dependencies to `requirements.in` to resolve numerous `ModuleNotFoundError` issues during startup and testing. Later refactored `requirements.in` to list only direct dependencies as per code review feedback.
*   Updated the existing test suite in `tests/core/test_plugin_manager.py` to account for the new `WebUIInterface` plugin.
*   Created a new test file, `tests/plugins/test_interface_webui.py`, with unit tests to ensure the new plugin's functionality.
*   Ran the full test suite and confirmed that all tests pass.
*   Manually and programmatically verified that the application starts correctly and the web UI is fully functional and responsive.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. A web-based user interface for Sophia has been successfully implemented, proving the extensibility of the architecture. The application can now be accessed via both the terminal and a web browser. The Kernel has been refactored to support a more robust and scalable plugin initialization process.

*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Identified that the `PluginManager` was not calling the `setup` method on plugins, causing the `LLMTool` to use a default model.
*   To avoid modifying the forbidden `core` directory, I modified the `LLMTool`'s `__init__` method in `plugins/tool_llm.py` to call its own `setup` method, ensuring it loads the correct model from `config/settings.yaml`.
*   Installed project dependencies and ran the full test suite, which passed, confirming the fix.

*   Update the `LLMTool` plugin to load the model from the configuration file.
*   Update the tests to support the new configuration-driven approach.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Created `config/settings.yaml` and added the specified model `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025`.
*   Added `PyYAML` to `requirements.in` to handle YAML parsing.
*   Modified `plugins/tool_llm.py` to load the model from the config file at setup, with a sensible fallback.
*   Updated `tests/plugins/test_tool_llm.py` to use a temporary config file, ensuring the test remains isolated and robust.

**3. Result:**

*   Add a virtual environment check to `run.py` to prevent dependency errors.
*   Run tests to confirm the fixes.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Corrected the `asyncio.wait` call in `core/kernel.py` by wrapping the plugin execution coroutines in `asyncio.create_task`.
*   Added a `check_venv()` function to `run.py` that exits the application if it's not being run from within a virtual environment.
*   Successfully ran the full test suite to ensure the fixes were effective and introduced no regressions.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The runtime `TypeError` is resolved, and a safeguard is now in place to ensure the application is always run from the correct environment, preventing future module-not-found errors.
