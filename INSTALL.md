# Installation and Setup Guide for Sophia V3

This guide provides simple instructions to get the Sophia V3 project running, specifically within a GitHub Codespace.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started in a GitHub Codespace

1.  **Open in Codespace:** Open this repository in a GitHub Codespace. The environment is pre-configured and should set up automatically.

2.  **Start Sophia:** Once the Codespace is loaded and the terminal is ready, start the application by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 guardian.py
    ```

3.  **Observe:** You should now see log output from both the Guardian and the main Sophia process in your terminal, indicating that the AGI is running its "Waking/Sleeping" lifecycle.
